# type-single-page
Thie page was created with the intention to explore the variety and creativity of the font Voto Serif GX created by Adam Twardoch. This site was created by Jamie O'Sullivan in Lara Henderson's Web Typography class at UMass Dartmouth, 2024. This is the second site I have created. I was initially drawn to the Voto Serif GX typeface bcause of its wide versatility. As shown on the site, there are many different styles that this typeface can take. I created the mockups for this site using Figma. Next, Lara helped me to set up a grid and I was able to transfer over the information I had created in Figma into the grid. I struggled a lot trying to make the site look visually enticing, but I was very satisfied with the hover elements that I added. This hover effect was created by using the 'span' effect in between each character. To make this process automatic, I utilized ChatGPT to add the span effect. This project challenged me to think of the site from a user-friendly perspective.
